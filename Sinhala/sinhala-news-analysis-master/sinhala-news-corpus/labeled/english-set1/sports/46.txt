Roger Federer scores 90th career title
Swiss tennis master, Roger Federer claimed his  90th overall tournament win of his career with a record-tying 5th victory at Indian Wells.Federer kept reminding everyone during the ATP Masters 1000 event that he was “on the comeback” and, wanting to see how he felt, hadn’t planned beyond the first three months of year. All the doubters can take a step back now, because Federer is clearly back!In an all-Swiss final, Federer played against the third seeded Stan Wawrinka. Fedrer won the first set with ease as Wawrinka failed to read the Federer serve. However, in the opening game of the second set, Wawrinka broke Federer for the first time in the tournament and raced to a 2-0 lead. In glorious style, Federer upped the ante towards the end winning three games in a row to bag the title.“This has been a fairy tale week,” said Federer. “It’s a beautiful feeling. Maybe it’s not as surprising as Australia but it’s still great to back it up by winning in America. It’s a dream start to the year. I have totally exceeded my expectations. It’s been an unbelievable start to the year.”Share This
