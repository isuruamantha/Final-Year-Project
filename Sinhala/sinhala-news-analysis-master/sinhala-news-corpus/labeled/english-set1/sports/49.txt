ICC Chairman resigns
In an unexpected development, Mr. Shashank Manohar resigned from his post as ICC chairman after a mere 8 months in office citing personal reasons.Manohar had mailed his resignation letter to ICC CEO Dave Richardson without clarifying the exact reason for this sudden move to end what was to be a two-year-tenure.“I was elected unopposed as the first independent Chairman of ICC last year. I have tried to do my best and have tried to be fair and impartial in deciding matters in the functioning of the Board and in matters related to Member Boards along with the able support of all Directors,” Manohar has stated in his resignation letter.Earlier this month, the ICC agreed “in principle” on a governance structure that included a new revenue distribution model, which seeks to address the current imbalance favouring the ‘Big Three’ (India, Australia, England).  A final decision on the new structure will be taken when the ICC meets in April.Share This
