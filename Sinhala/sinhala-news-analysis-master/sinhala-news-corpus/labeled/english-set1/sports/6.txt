Usain Bolt narrowly wins 100 metres
Eight-time Olympic sprinting champion Usain Bolt ran under 10 seconds for the first time this year as he narrowly won the 100 metres at the Monaco Diamond League meeting yesterday.The Jamaican was slow out of the blocks, just as he was in his last race in Ostrava last month, and never managed to put a big gap between him and the field.He won in 9.95 seconds, three hundredths of a second ahead of American Isiah Young. South Africa’s Akani Simbine was third in 10.02.Before the meeting, Bolt went to Germany to have treatment on back issues that have troubled him for years. It was his last outing before next month’s World Championships in London where he will race in the 100 metres and 4x100m relay.In the 400 metres, Wayde van Niekerk also faced a tougher race than expected. The South African cruised past Botswana’s Isaac Makwala on the back straight before Makwala fought back all the way to the end, pushing van Niekerk all the way to the line.Van Niekerk finished the race in 43.73 seconds.Share This
