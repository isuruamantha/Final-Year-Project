As yet the tour is not officially postponed or cancelled, despite media reports.”It added: “We promise that as soon as we have clear information we’ll let everyone know. Thank you again for bearing with us in what is a difficult time for all involved.”Replying to the statement on Twitter, one fan said: “This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The uncertainty is only causing greater distress to distraught young fans.”Many said it appeared unlikely the show would go ahead, with another fan writing: “She’s back at home in Boca [Florida].
