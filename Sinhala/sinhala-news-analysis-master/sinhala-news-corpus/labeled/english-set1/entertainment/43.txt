His tribute song was accompanied by a montage of photographs of the pair.Todd Fisher called it a “beautiful song to Carrie”, adding that “it might rip your heart out”.Actor Dan Ackroyd, her former fiance, was among speakers, and told how he once saved her life when she nearly choked on a Brussels sprout.“If I’d been with our beloved showboat [when she died], I might have been able to save her again,” he said.Todd Fisher described the moments before his mother died: “She literally asked permission and said she wanted to be with Carrie.“She closed her eyes and went to sleep. It was a very peaceful exit that only my mother could orchestrate. It was a beautiful exit.”Carrie Fisher died aged 60 on 27 December, days after suffering a cardiac arrest. Her mother died a day later after a suspected stroke.Earlier Fisher said the public was invited to the memorial “because that’s how my mother would want it”.He added that she was “very connected to her fans and felt they were a part of her”.The public ceremony follows a private memorial service, which took place in January and was attended by stars including Meryl Streep, Gwyneth Paltrow and Meg Ryan.Courtesy: BBCShare This
