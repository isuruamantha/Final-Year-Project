Why Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman salary seems low compared to male actors
Gal Gadot has pocketed a lot less for her role in Wonder Woman so far than Henry Cavill earned for Man of Steel – but it’s more complicated than it first seems.A tweet comparing the pair’s wages was shared more than 14,000 times.Gal was paid $300k (£237k) for Wonder Woman, while estimates suggest Henry Cavill earned $14m (£11m) as Superman.But his fee, if true, came after he was paid box office bonuses for the 2013 movie.The controversy was sparked by a tweet from a US journalist, who said: “The most compelling DC villain is the pay gap.” It has since been deleted.Gal Gadot’s $300,000 pay cheque was first announced in 2014 along with her roles in Batman v Superman, Wonder Woman and the upcoming Justice League.But many actors will also pick up extra cash from their movies’ box office success.And if that’s the case for Gal, she will earn a tidy sum after the Wonder Woman receipts have been totaled.Wonder Woman has made an estimated $578m (£458m) so far and it’s still drawing people to cinemas across the world.In comparison, Man Of Steel made $668m (£529m) and that film was released four years ago.US website The Vulture claims that Henry Cavill, who launched his Hollywood career as Superman, was paid a “six-figure sum”, similar to Gal Gadot.They also claimed his co-star, Amy Adams, was paid a substantially higher fee for her role as love interest Lois Lane.His total earnings, the $14m (£11.1m) that has been widely cited online, have also been called into question.The number originated on a website called The Richest, which only estimates how much a celebrity is worth.But it has been reported as fact in some places.    Source: BBCShare This
