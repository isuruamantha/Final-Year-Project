Oscars 2017: Highlights, Lowlights & unfortunate Spotlights
The 2017 Oscars are being widely hailed as one of the best with amazing artist performances and many new entrants winning the prestigious award.Wrong winner announcedThe most memorable moment of the night however, was an embarrassing Steve Harvey style mix up that resulted in audience favorite “La La Land” being announced as the winner instead of “Moonlight”, the rightful victor.After giving their acceptance speech, the producers of “La La Land” took the mic and said they actually lost the award to “Moonlight. One of the producers held out the Oscar and said “This is not a joke.’Moonlight’ has won Best Picture.”Warren Beatty, who initially presented the award to “La La Land,” said he wasn’t kidding around when he announced the winner. He explained that it was a genuine mistake and said “I opened the envelope, and it said Emma Stone, ‘La La Land’ and that’s why I took a long look,” Beatty said. “I wasn’t trying to be funny.”Moonlight director Barry Jenkins was very gracious about the mix-up and upon accepting the award that was rightfully his, he said: ‘Very clearly, even in my dreams, this could not be true. But to hell with dreams, I’m done with it – ’cause this is true. Oh my goodness.’Moonlight is a beautifully told story about the difficulties facing a boy who grew up poor, black and gay.“Moonlight” is at times an almost unbearably personal film and an urgent social document that takes a hard look at American reality. In addition to “Best Picture’, it also won Best Supporting Actor as well as Best Adapted Screenplay.Most political moments at the OscarsEven though the Twitter-happy President of the United States was not present at the awards ceremony, that didn’t stop Hollywood’s darlings from speaking out about their grievances.Iranian director, Asghar Farhadi, won Best Foreign language film for “The Salesman”, but wasn’t in attendance to accept his award. In his stead, two surrogates—Anousheh Ansari, the first Muslim woman in space, and Firouz Naderi, a former director at NASA—took the stage and read a letter from Farhadi: “My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of the other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S. Dividing the world into the ‘us’ and ‘our enemies’ categories creates fear—a deceitful justification for aggression and war.”Although most people will remember Warren Beatty for his mistake in reading out the wrong winner for Best Picture, the veteran of the cinema industry made an important comment earlier in the night. “It could be said that our goal in politics is the same as our goal in art, which is to get to truth. The movies that we honor tonight not only entertain us and move us, they show us the increasing diversity in our community and a respect for diversity and freedom all over the world.”Complete Winners listBEST PICTURE“Arrival”“Fences”“Hacksaw Ridge”“Hell or High Water”“Hidden Figures”“La La Land”“Lion”“Manchester by the Sea”“Moonlight” (WINNER)ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLECasey Affleck in “Manchester by the Sea” (WINNER)Andrew Garfield in “Hacksaw Ridge”Ryan Gosling in “La La Land”Viggo Mortensen in “Captain Fantastic”Denzel Washington in “Fences”ACTOR IN A SUPPORTING ROLEJeff Bridges in “Hell or High Water”Mahershala Ali in “Moonlight” (WINNER)Lucas Hedges in “Manchester by the Sea”Dev Patel in “Lion”Michael Shannon in “Nocturnal Animals”ACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLEIsabelle Huppert in “Elle”Ruth Negga in “Loving”Natalie Portman in “Jackie”Emma Stone in “La La Land” (WINNER)Meryl Streep in “Florence Foster Jenkins”ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLENicole Kidman in “Lion”Viola Davis in “Fences”Naomie Harris in “Moonlight”Octavia Spencer in “Hidden Figures”Michelle Williams in “Manchester by the Sea”ANIMATED FEATURE FILM“Kubo and the Two Strings”“Moana”“My Life as a Zucchini”“The Red Turtle”“Zootopia” (WINNER)CINEMATOGRAPHY“Arrival”“La La Land” (WINNER)“Lion”“Moonlight”“Silence”COSTUME DESIGN“Allied”“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” (WINNER)“Florence Foster Jenkins”“Jackie”“La La Land”“FantasticDIRECTING“Arrival” – Denis Villeneuve“Hacksaw Ridge” – Mel Gibson“La La Land” – Damien Chazelle (WINNER)“Manchester by the Sea” – Kenneth Lonergan“Moonlight” – Barry JenkinsDOCUMENTARY (FEATURE)“Fire at Sea”“I Am Not Your Negro”“Life, Animated”“O.J.: Made in America” (WINNER)“13th”DOCUMENTARY (SHORT SUBJECT)“Extremis”“4.1 Miles”“Joe’s Violin”“Watani: My Homeland”“The White Helmets” (WINNER)FILM EDITING“Arrival”“Hacksaw Ridge” (WINNER)“Hell or High Water”“La La Land”“Moonlight”FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM“Land of Mine”“A Man Called Ove”“The Salesman” (WINNER)“Tanna”“Toni Erdmann”MAKEUP AND HAIRSTYLING“A Man Called Ove”“Star Trek Beyond”“Suicide Squad” (WINNER)MUSIC (ORIGINAL SCORE)“Jackie”“La La Land” (WINNER)“Lion”“Moonlight”“Passengers”MUSIC (ORIGINAL SONG)“Audition (The Fools Who Dream)” from “La La Land”“Can’t Stop The Feeling” from “Trolls”“City Of Stars” from “La La Land” (WINNER)“The Empty Chair” from “Jim: The James Foley Story”“How Far I’ll Go” from “Moana”PRODUCTION DESIGN“Arrival”“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”“Hail, Caesar!”“La La Land” (WINNER)“Passengers”ANIMATED SHORT FILM“Blind Vaysha”“Borrowed Time”“Pear Cider and Cigarettes”“Pearl”“Piper” (WINNER)LIVE ACTION SHORT FILM“Ennemis Intérieurs”“La Femme et le TGV”“Silent Nights”“Sing” (WINNER)“Timecode”SOUND EDITING“Arrival” (WINNER)“Deepwater Horizon”“Hacksaw Ridge”“La La Land”“Sully”SOUND MIXING“Arrival”“Hacksaw Ridge” (WINNER)“La La Land”“Rogue One: A Star Wars Story”“13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi”VISUAL EFFECTS“Deepwater Horizon”“Doctor Strange”“The Jungle Book” (WINNER)“Kubo and the Two Strings”“Rogue One: A Star Wars Story”WRITING (ADAPTED SCREENPLAY)“Arrival”“Fences“Hidden Figures”“Lion”“Moonlight” (WINNER)WRITING (ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY)“Hell or High Water”“La La Land”“The Lobster”“Manchester by the Sea” (WINNER)“20th Century Women”   Share This
