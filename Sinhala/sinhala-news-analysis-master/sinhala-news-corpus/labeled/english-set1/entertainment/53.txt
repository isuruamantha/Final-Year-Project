Shakira and Vives accused of plagiarism
Song named ‘La Bicicleta’ was marked a hit last year, that it won last year’s Grammy Latino. However, Cuban musician Livan Rafael Castellanos has filed a complaint against the Colombian pop stars Shakira and Carlos Vives, the artists of ‘La Bicicleta’. They were accused of plagiarising part of a song Castellanos wrote ten years ago.The complaint was filed at a court in Spain, where Shakira lives.Castellanos claimed that Shakira and Vives copied a line and part of the chorus of his 1997 song Yo Te Quiero Tanto.The above is centred around an intellectual property problem and focuses mainly on the melody and the lyrics of the choruses of both songs, a Spokesperson for the Court claimed.Shakira and Vives song sings que te sueno y que te quiero tanto which means “I dream of you and love you so much”, but Castellanos song sings yo te quiero, yo te quiero tanto which means “I love you, I love you so much”.A Spanish newspaper reports that the two sides convened a meeting in October but they failed to reach a settlement.Share This
