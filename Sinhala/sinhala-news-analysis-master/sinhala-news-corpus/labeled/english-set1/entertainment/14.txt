Sweden to host ‘man-free’ music festival next year
Swedish comedian Emma Knyckare is organising a “man-free” music festival in Sweden in response to rape and sexual assault claims at festivals.The idea came after a number of sexual offences at Sweden’s biggest music festival “Bravalla”.Knyckare floated the idea in a tweet at the weekend.“What do you think about putting together a really cool festival where only non-men are welcome, that we’ll run until ALL men have learned how to behave themselves?” she wrote.A day after her initial tweet, she confirmed plans for the event to go ahead, saying: “Sweden’s first man-free rock festival will see the light next summer”.Share This
