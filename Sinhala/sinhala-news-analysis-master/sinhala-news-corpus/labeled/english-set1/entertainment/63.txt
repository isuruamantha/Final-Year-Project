Affleck gives up directing Batman
Ben Affleck has decided to step down as director of ” The Batman”  and remain on as a producer and star of the project.Affleck is still on board to play the superhero, but sources close to the talent said Affleck and Warner Bros., after discussing how to best make the film possible, came to the decision together.“There are certain characters who hold a special place in the hearts of millions,” Affleck said in a statement. “Performing this role demands focus, passion and the very best performance I can give. It has become clear that I cannot do both jobs to the level they require. Together with the studio, I have decided to find a partner in a director who will collaborate with me on this massive film.I am still in this, and we are making it, but we are currently looking for a director. I remain extremely committed to this project, and look forward to bringing this to life for fans around the world.” Affleck debuted his take on Batman in last year’s Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice and was generally praised even among the film’s harshest critics. He looks poised to be the point-of-view character and de facto lead in this year’s Justice League movie, which sees Batman and Wonder Woman assembling the titular superhero team. Share This
