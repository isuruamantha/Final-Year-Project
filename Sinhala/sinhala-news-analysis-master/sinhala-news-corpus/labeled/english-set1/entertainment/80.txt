21st Century Fox makes takeover bid for Sky
US media giant 21st Century Fox has made a takeover approach for Sky that values the UK-based satellite broadcaster at £18.5bn.The proposed offer is worth £10.75 a share in cash, a premium of 36% to the closing price on 8 December.Sky shares ended 26.6% higher at 999.8p in London following the announcement.Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch controls 21st Century Fox, which already owns a 39.1% stake in Sky.Sky said that the independent directors of both companies had “reached agreement on an offer price” of £10.75 a share, but added that “certain material offer terms remain under discussion”.Fox said Sky’s directors had indicated that they were willing to recommend the proposed offer.According to Reuters’ calculations, Fox would pay £11.25bn for the stake in Sky that it did not already own.Sterling’s 16% fall against the US dollar in the wake of the Brexit vote has made UK companies more attractive targets for foreign companies.Fox is required to “clarify its intentions” by 6 January, or walk away for at least six months under UK takeover rules.Alex DeGroote, analyst at Peel Hunt, said it was “not quite a done deal”, but he would be surprised if it did not go ahead.“Sky has not performed well in the UK stock market this year, and is seen as a Brexit loser. Fox is of course also a dollar bidder, and the collapse in sterling makes Sky a less expensive purchase than pre-Brexit,” he said.“There will also be cost synergies, which will reflect economies of scale in technology and content, such as sports and movie rights.”Source : BBCShare This
