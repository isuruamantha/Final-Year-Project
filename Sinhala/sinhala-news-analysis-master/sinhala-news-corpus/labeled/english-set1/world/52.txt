North Korea Guam missile strike plan ‘ready by mid-August’
North Korea says it will be ready by mid-August to fire four missiles near the US territory of Guam, as a war of words with Washington intensifies.State media said Hwasong-12 rockets would pass over Japan and land in the sea about 30km (17 miles) from Guam, if the plan was approved by Kim Jong-un.It denounced Donald Trump’s warnings of “fire and fury” and said the US president was “bereft of reason”.The US has warned the North its actions could mean the “end of its regime”.US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said Pyongyang would be “grossly overmatched” in any war against the US and its allies.The North first announced on Wednesday that it was drawing up plans for a missile strike against Guam, which is home to US military bases, strategic bombers and about 163,000 people.A later statement carried by state media said the military would “finally complete the plan” by mid-August and report it to leader Kim Jong-un for his approval.“The Hwasong-12 rockets to be launched by the KPA [Korean People’s Army] will cross the sky above Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi [Kochi] Prefectures of Japan,” state news agency KCNA said, quoting army chief General Kim Rak Gyom.“They will fly 3,356.7km for 1,065 seconds and hit the waters 30-40km away from Guam.”The Hwasong missiles are North Korea’s domestically produced medium and long-range weapons.The statement said President Trump’s remarks on Tuesday that the North risked “fire and fury” for threatening the US were “a load of nonsense”.“Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him,” it addedThe statement said President Trump’s remarks on Tuesday that the North risked “fire and fury” for threatening the US were “a load of nonsense”.“Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him,” it added.Amid escalating rhetoric, Mr Mattis issued a strongly worded statement on Wednesday, calling on Pyongyang to halt its arms programme.“The DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons,” he said.Amid escalating rhetoric, Mr Mattis issued a strongly worded statement on Wednesday, calling on Pyongyang to halt its arms programme.“The DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons,” he said.-BBCShare This
