Australia’s Deputy PM revealed to be a dual citizen
New Zealand’s government has confirmed that Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, is a dual citizen.Dual citizens are not allowed to run for public office under Australia’s constitution.Joyce is potentially the fifth politician in recent weeks to fall foul of constitutional rules barring dual citizens from Australia’s parliament.The country’s Prime Minister Bill English also confirmed the problematic status, saying: “Unwittingly or not, he’s a New Zealand citizen.”If Joyce is forced out of parliament, the Turnbull government would lose its one-seat majority in the House of Representatives. Joyce is the first lower house member and the most senior minister to face questions about his eligibility.Share This
