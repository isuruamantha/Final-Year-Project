Israel moves to close local operations of Al Jazeera
Israel’s communication minister, Ayoub Kara, announced of plans to revoke media credentials of Al Jazeera journalists and close the network’s office in Jerusalem.The closure did not appear imminent, however, and an Israeli official said a legal process was still required to implement most of the proposed steps.The Israeli move adds further pressure on Qatar, which has been involved in a dispute with four of it’s Arab neighbours.According to Kara, this announcement came as a direct continuation of the decision made by a majority of the Gulf Sunni states, which determined that Al Jazeera supports terrorism and religious extremism.Share This
