Russian PM says new U.S. sanctions amount to ‘full-scale trade war’
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has said new sanctions imposed by the US are tantamount to declaring a “full-scale trade war” against Moscow.The law aims to punish Russia for it’s alleged meddling in the 2016 US elections and its actions in Ukraine.The legislation also imposes sanctions on Iran and North Korea.The Russian PM said that the measures, signed by Donald Trump, demonstrated the complete impotence of the US President, whom he said had been humiliated by Congress.Trump had on the other hand, accused Congress of overreach on the legislation.In signing the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, he attached a statement calling the measure “deeply flawed”.Share This
