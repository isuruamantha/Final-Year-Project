US notifies it wants to pullout from the Paris climate deal
The Trump administration has issued it’s first written notification that the US intends to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement.The State Department described it’s communication as a “strong message” to the world, following Donald Trump’s decision in June to leave the accord.Currently, all but two nations — Syria and Nicaragua — are signatories to the accord.However, the process of leaving takes another year, meaning it would not be complete until just weeks after the US Presidential election in 2020.Any new US President could then decide to rejoin the agreement.Share This
