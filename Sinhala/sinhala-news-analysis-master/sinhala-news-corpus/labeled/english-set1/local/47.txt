Thilanga Sumathipala accepts his connection to a gambling company: Ceylon Today newspaper
With mounting pressure against Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket, Thilanga Sumathipala to resign from his post, the Ceylon Today reports that Sumathipala has accepted his connection to a gambling company.According to the case report of the defamation case filed by Thilanga Sumathipala against Arjuna Ranatunga, cross examination of Sumathipala had revealed his connections to the gaming industry.The Ceylon Today quoting page 14 of the court report, notes that Sumathipala had accepted the fact that ‘Sporting Star‘ is a book making business, and he and his family are associated with it.The newspaper also reports that Sumathipala and his family members are also the owners of a leading media and publication company as well as a sports gear company.Ceylon Today notes that all three are in direct violation of Sri Lanka’s sports law, which clearly states that a person who is associated with the gaming industry, who owns a media company or a sports goods selling company, is not eligible to hold a post in a national sports association.This is not the first time that Thilanga Sumathipala has come under fire for his connections to the gaming industry. In 2005, during his previous tenure as Sri Lanka Cricket Chairman, ICC Ethics Officer Oliver Stocken conducted an inquiry into Sumathipala ‘s business dealings and alleged connections to gaming industry.Share This
