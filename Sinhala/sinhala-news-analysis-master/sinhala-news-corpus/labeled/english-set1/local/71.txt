Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Bond Scam: Missing files, contradictions and other ‘mysteries’
The IT Executive of Perpetual Treasuries Limited has lied to the detectives assisting the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond Scam.CID detectives and the Attorney General’s Department questioned the IT Executive from Monday night and made this breakthrough on Wednesday morning.Sachith Devatantri, the Senior IT Executive had said he called the Metropolitan Communications officer, Neranjan, on July 21, 2017 to perform the reconfiguration.However, GPS coordinates obtained from the mobile device of Neranjan revealed he was in fact in Bolawalana, Negombo on that day, thereby contradicting Devantantri’s statement.In addition, call records from Neranjan’s service provider show there were no calls between him and Devatantri from Perpetual Treasuries Limited on that day.The Presidential Commission issued an order permitting engineers from Metropolitan Communications (Pvt) Limited to examine the four CDs containing the back-up data of the system installed at Perpetual Treasuries Limited.The Commission permitted the examination on the desktop computer provided by Metropolitan Communications (Pvt) Ltd to Perpetual Treasuries Limited as well as the new desktop computer installed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited.Perpetual Treasuries Limited claimed it replaced the original desktop computer due to a malfunction.The Attorney General’s Department wished to know if it actually malfunctioned and how it happened.The parent company of Metropolitan Communications (Pvt.) Ltd, Indian based Xtend Technologies Pvt Ltd says the Xtend Voice Logger software at Perpetual Treasuries Limited was re-installed on July 06, 2017 at 12 noon.It must be noted that the Monetary Board of the Central Bank suspended Perpetual Treasuries Limited from carrying on business and other activities as a Primary Dealer on the 06th of July 2017.During re-installation, the wave files of calls had been copied to the system on July 20,2017 from an external location.Despite re-installing the software, for the system to function properly, it must be configured.The Chief Engineer at Metropolitan Communications (Pvt) Ltd. revealed the system was re-configured twice on July 21, 2017.Perpetual Treasuries Limited had entered the system using the username and password given to the System Administrator of Perpetual Treasuries Limited.A heated argument broke between President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa and Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera during the cross examination.De Livera alleged that Indatissa was pointing the finger at the Officers of the Attorney General’s Department. He however denied it.Justice Prasanna Jayawardena brought the situation under control stating nobody is above the law and that Indatissa must raise questions on the relevancy of the matter.The Chief Engineer of Metropolitan Communications (Pvt) Ltd revealed that the remote examination carried out by Xtend Technologies showed the movement of wave files but that the relevant data was missing.Share This
