Out there representing with honor and a great spirit. A real amazon. You made us all proud. Thank you ! @GalGadot https://t.co/61oSbwv4xg— Patty Jenkins (@PattyJenks) September 1, 2017“First I was shocked,”Suriyapperuma told the BBC. I didn’t really let it get to me although I was genuinely baffled at why these people would spend their valuable time hating someone they don’t even know.”Her fellow cosplayer agrees. “I was offended and shocked at how the internet reacted,” said Cooray, “Most of the memes and comments I received seemed to objectify me.”She claimed she was drawn to the character of Wonder Woman as she feels it empowers young women like herself to be independent and strong minded.Share This
