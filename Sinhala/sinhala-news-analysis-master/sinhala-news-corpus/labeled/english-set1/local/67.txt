Royal Air Force opens combat roles to women
The Royal Air Force has become the first branch of the British military to open up every role to both men and women.From today it will accept applications from women to join the RAF Regiment – its ground-fighting force.The move follows a decision last year, to lift the ban on females serving in close combat roles.The main role of the 2,000-strong RAF Regiment, which sustained casualties in Afghanistan, is to patrol and protect RAF bases and airfields.The RAF’s women will not be the first allowed to serve in close combat roles, as some recently joined the Royal Armoured Corps.However, it will be another year before women can apply to enter Army Infantry Units and the Royal Marines, where the physical demands can be tougher. The ban on women serving in close combat units was lifted by then Prime Minister David Cameron in 2016.Share This
