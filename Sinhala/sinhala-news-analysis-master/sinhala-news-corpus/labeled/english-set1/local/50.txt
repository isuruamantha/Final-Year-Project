A run for the ages: This 81 year old took the American Ninja Warrior course!
It’s a common sight to see young folk complain about injuries and ‘not being fit enough’ or feeling weak these days.Even those in their late 20s to mid 30s and 40s, especially those who used to do sports during their school/college years and stopped abruptly tend to have the same complaints.We complain of joints hurting, muscle strains, body becoming stiff, you name it. We all have done it, and so have I –Guilty as charged.But not this guy we are going to talk about right now.His name is Arthur Hickenlooper, he is 81 years old and he has taken part in the American Ninja Warrior course!No, you did not misread that. 81 years of age – took part in the American Ninja Warrior course.To those who do not know what the Ninja Warrior course is, it is an extreme obstacle course focusing on endurance and agility.Even professional athletes with fit, ripped bodies, trained to take on such runs, have failed to complete the course.And then there is Arthur. This retired postal worker from Denver, USA did not fail to deliver, even after retirement…TAKE A LOOK YOURSELF – because you will not believe anything anybody writes about it unless you see it.The video is an embed from the official Ninja Warrior Facebook account.Arthur gives, shows and proves to all across the world, that nobody is never ‘too old’ to do anything and that the attitude of ‘Never giving up’ will only take you to greater heights.As said on the NW official page, never judge a book by it’s cover.To prove this point even further, here is a video of 65 year-old John Loobey contesting in the same course! He could not complete the course but managed to get through most obstacles which, a shame to say, most youngsters will not even get close to.Share This
