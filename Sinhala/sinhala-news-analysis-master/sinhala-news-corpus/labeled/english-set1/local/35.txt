Binara Full Moon Poya: The day when Meheni Sasanaya commenced
The Binara Poya Day holds special significance for Buddhists across the globe for numerous reasons, including the anniversary of the commencement of theÂ Meheni Sasanaya.The beginning of the Bhikkuni Sasanaya was also recorded on Binara Full Moon Poya Day.When the Blessed One was residing at Nigrodharamaya in the city of Kapilavasthu, Mahaprajapathi Gothami requested permission for women to enter the Order.After laying down the Eight Tenets of the code to be followed by the Bhikkhunis, Lord Buddha granted permission for the women to enter the Order.The other significance of this Poya day is that it falls during the Vas retreat season of Bhikkhunis.The Bhikkhunis who are in Vas retreat in temples get engaged in acts of guiding laymen in the Dhamma path by ways of Dhamma sermons, and advising and helping them in religious rituals such as Bodhi Poojas.Share This
