Caribbean and Southern United States brace for ‘Hurricane Irma’
As Sri Lanka faces the impact of the torrential rain, Hurricane Irma, is barreling towards the Caribbean and the Southern United States.Earlier today, Irma was upgraded to a powerful Category 5 storm.The US National Hurricane Centre said the hurricane had sustained winds of up to 220km/h and was likely to strengthen in the next 48 hours.Hurricane advisories were issued for territories that dot the West Indies, including parts of the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, in preparation for the intensifying storm that could pummel the area with life-threatening wind, storm surges and torrential rain by later today.Irma, now packing 130 mph winds, also threatens the U.S. East Coast and Florida, which last evening declared a state of emergency. The Hurricane Center expects Irma to reach Southern Florida on Saturday.It comes as residents in Texas and Louisiana are reeling from the effects of Hurricane Harvey, which struck as a category four storm, causing heavy rain and destroying thousands of homes.The National Hurricane Centre cautioned that it was too early to forecast the storm’s exact path or what effects it might have on the continental United States, but warned of likely effects to hit some areas by later this week.Share This
