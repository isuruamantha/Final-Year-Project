China bans weird and long company names
China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce has banned companies from registering “weird” names, according to a set of guidelines that went into effect on Saturday.Entrepreneurs in the country have in the past registered their companies under rather interesting names, such as “King of Nanning, Guangxi, and His Friends Trading Co. Ltd” and “Beijing Under My Wife’s Thumb Technology Co. Ltd.,” Sixth Tone said.The rules also banned the registration of names that referenced terrorism and extremism, as well as those that attempted to mimic the names of already-registered businesses. Using the names of former leaders who had passed on, such as Mao Zedong, in company names was also not allowed as that could be misleading, the guidelines said.Last year, Beijing banned any more “bizarre” buildings. In recent years the country has seen buildings shaped like a teapot and another resembling a pair of trousers.Share This
