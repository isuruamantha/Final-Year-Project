Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif resigns
Nawaz Sharif has resigned as Prime Minister of Pakistan following a decision by the country’s Supreme Court to disqualify him from office.The ruling came after a probe into his family’s wealth in the wake of the leaked 2016 Panama Papers, which linked PM Sharif’s children to offshore firms.Sharif has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the case.The five judges reached an unanimous verdict in the Islamabad court, which was filled to capacity.One of the judges, Ejaz Afzal Khan, said that Sharif was no longer “eligible to be an honest member of the parliament”.Pakistan’s Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan earlier advised Sharif to accept Friday’s verdict.The court has recommended anti-corruption cases against several individuals, including Sharif, his daughter Maryam and her husband Safdar, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and others.Share This
