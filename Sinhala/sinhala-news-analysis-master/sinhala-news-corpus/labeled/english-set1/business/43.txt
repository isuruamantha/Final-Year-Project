If Muhunthan Canagey lacks efficiency, the subject minister has the power to remove him: Minister Kabir Hashim
Minister Kabir Hashim remarked that if there are shortcomings regarding the efficiency of the CEO of the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA), Muhunthan Canagey, then the subject minister has the power to remove him.Hashim made this statement today, in response to persistent questions from journalists regarding the ICTA CEO’s involvement in several projects that have failed..Muhunthan Canagey is the CEO of the Information and Communication Technology Agency.The Google Loon project, touted by Canagey as a project that would provide low-cost internet access for the entire country, is still a pipe-dream.This project has failed because the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) refused to provide the 700 megahertz bandwidth requested to carry out testing for the project, citing regulations by the International Telecommunication Union.Recent investigations undertaken by News1st revealed that a company known as ‘Rama’ had attempted to secure bandwidth, under the guise of implementing the Google Loon project.In the face of the continuous refusals to provide the bandwidth requested, Muhunthan Canagey had stated in a weekend newspaper that talks are underway with the International Telecommunication Union regarding this matter.He claimed that as the bandwidth is to be used for tests by a state institution, it is not necessary to call for tenders.However, News1st exposed in the recent past that, the true business motivation driving the Rama company, was securing bandwidth licences.Responding to inquiries from News1st, the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission noted that the 700 megahertz bandwidth would not be provided.The TRC added that while there are other bandwidths which can be allocated for upper atmosphere transmissions like the Google Loon project, the TRC has the power to make these bandwidths available.Share This
